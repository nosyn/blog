# Welcome!

Son Yen Nguyen aka **_nosyn_**.
A Vietnamese software developer with a passion for coding, hiking, traveling,
and spending time with my family. I was born and raised in Vietnam, and had
the opportunity to further my education in the United States, attending
Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi.
As a full web stack developer, I have honed my skills in front-end,
back-end, databases, and cloud technologies. I am currently working as a web
developer at Plus One Robotics in San Antonio, Texas. With my diverse
background and a love for technology, I'm excited to share my experiences
and insights with others in the software development community.
